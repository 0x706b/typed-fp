# @fp/io

An integration with `@fp` and [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts)' experimental [Schema API](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts/blob/master/Schema.md). This module provides an extension to the base Schemable interfaces for things like `Map`, `Set`, `Option`, `Either` and a number of other useful types. There are also implementations of `Decoder`, `Eq` and `Guard`.

Since these modules are considered to be "experimental" this module is also. It's quite possible io-ts will make breaking changes or delete them altogether so we'll see what we want to do if/when we get there.
