# fp-to-the-max

This example is inspired by the [fp-to-the-max](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/examples/fp-ts-to-the-max-II.ts) 
example inside of `fp-ts` itself and is hopefully a helpful transition for those coming with 
knowledge of `fp-ts` and hopefully not. 

For fun we've added the ability to choose the integers you can guess between and keeps track of your 
wins and your losses.

# Run it
