# @typed/fp

`@typed/fp` is conceptually an extension of [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/), with
[cancelable async effects](./modules/Resume.ts.md), [streams](https://github.com/mostjs/core),
[state management](./modules/Ref.ts.md), and more.

This project is under heavy development. We intend to align with `fp-ts` v3. A 1.0 will be released
once both codebases are stable.
