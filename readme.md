# @typed/fp

`@typed/fp` is composed of many Ã -la-carte modules to help build applications that work everywhere ES modules do. `@typed/fp` is happy to say it is a part of the larger [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) and [@most/core](https://github.com/mostjs/core) communities. 

# Install (Not Yet!)

```sh
npm i --save @typed/fp
yarn add @typed/fp
```

## Support

Only modern environments are supported out of the box. For browsers, the last 2 major versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge are supported. The latest stable and long-term-support releases for Node are supported, too. Lets keep the web improving!

> Pull requests are always welcomed for documenting any polyfill setup required for supporting any other platforms ðŸ˜„
