# @typed/fp

`@typed/fp` is composed of many Ã -la-carte modules to help build applications that work everywhere ES modules do. `@typed/fp` is happy to say it is a part of the larger [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) and [@most/core](https://github.com/mostjs/core) communities. 

# Install (Not Yet!)

```sh
npm i --save @typed/fp
yarn add @typed/fp
```

## Support

At present only modern environments that support ES2019 Syntax and dynamic imports. Lets keep the web improving and stick with the standards! 
This includes the last ~2 versions of Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, Safari, Edge and include Node 12+.

> Pull requests are always welcomed for documenting any polyfill setup required for supporting any other environments ðŸ˜„
