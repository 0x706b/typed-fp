# @typed/fp

`@typed/fp` is conceptually an extension of [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/), with
cancelable async effects, [streams](https://github.com/mostjs/core), state management, and more.

This project is under heavy development. We intend to align with `fp-ts` v3. A 1.0 will be released
once both codebases are stable.
