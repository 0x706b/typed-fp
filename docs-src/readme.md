# @typed/fp

`@typed/fp` is composed of many Ã -la-carte modules, bringing together [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) and [@most/core](https://mostcore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
with Algebraic Effects and other useful data structures and libraries to help build frontend-focused TypeScript applications.

While not a requirement for usage, the design of `@typed/fp` has been geared towards developing applications using Domain-Driven Design and Onion/Hexagonal/Clean Architectural patterns.

Until a v1.0.0 there will likely be many more breaking changes, but it's getting to the point where it's very much usable and the key pieces of complexity have been tested.
